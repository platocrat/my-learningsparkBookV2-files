My attempt at making it through "Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Data Analytics", 2nd Edition, released July 2020 in Emacs. Was using the Metals integration for Emacs; however, Scala itself -- including `sbt` -- came with a lot of broken libraries/packages. Time is much better spent utilizing Python for Spark applications.
The book's official GitHub repository can be found at https://github.com/databricks/LearningSparkV2

## Stick to writing Spark apps in Python to save yourself from future headaches (and make sure to grab yourself a great cup/glass of tea üçµ  while you're at it).
(if you are wondering why, read the README.md in `/chapter2/`.)
