# chapter2 "workbook"-like files
These are files I used to follow along with the text.

## Note to self...
### _Scala is an utter mess!_ 
Why you may ask??

Oh, it is because now I have an empty directory on my 16-inch Mac that REFUSES to remove itself, and, yes, `rm -rf` does _not_ work, nor does Emacs' GUI `d` command (with recursive `all`), nor does Finder!

Amusingly, when attempting the Finder method, the directory `my-learningspark-files` replaces itself back inside the root directory from where it was deleted. We will see who has the last laugh...
